! unify config file and top-level command-line options: need to parse config file first, then apply options
! save entries to local DB so can be uploaded later
! gather stderr/stdout
  ! rate limit their upload
  * tail/cat

* says "unable to communicate with server" if the process won't die
* configurable timeouts
* send logp version info to eventstore
* config file examples
* instead of print "<1s" why not print "231ms"?
* if an event gets timed out due to heartbeat, but logp is still running (perhaps it was stopped) then it
  can't upload its info and it gets errors like this:
    logp: warning: error from server for hrt op: not expecting heartbeat for this event id
    logp: warning: error from server for add op: event already ended
    logp: error: was unable to communicate with log periodic server
